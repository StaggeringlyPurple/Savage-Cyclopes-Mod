### **Mobs**

Cyclopes have evolved thick skin which prevents them from being damaged by Arrows, Poisonous Darts, and other Projectiles.
 
- The **Cyclops Barrage** launches six darts in rapid succession (but using a name tag called "swift_shot" you can increase the count to 
 	thirty - I know how much people love to troll their friends).  Each dart inflicts Poison IV for 30 seconds and deals a few hearts 
 	of impact damage as well.  It drops Poison Darts as an item.
 
- The **Cyclops Brute** is essentially a buffed Vindicator, having 80 health points and dealing 35 damage to an unarmored player.
 
- The **Shriveled Cyclops** is a decaying cyclops that will rarely be found in the desert.  It drops Rotten Flesh.
 
- The **Glacial Cyclops** is basically a Cyclops Brute but is covered in icy spines that damage you when you try to attack it.  It also 
 	inflicts the "Freezing" effect when it hits you.  It is found in the Ice Palace and has a chance to drop Ice Shards, Bludgeons, 	 
 	Polar Hide, or Leather

- **Cyclops Imposters** have a small chance to spawn in place of villagers (only in villages, not from spawn eggs).  If you punch them, they get angry
   and try to attack you.  No problem, right? Just don't punch villagers? **WRONG!!!** If you even try to trade with them, they become angry and target you.
  If you are able to defeat one, you may obtain a Trading Charm.
