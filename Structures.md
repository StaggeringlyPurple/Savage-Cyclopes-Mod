### **STRUCTURES**

- **Jungle Enclaves** are village-like structures that generate roads around a central (partially destroyed) building and generate smaller 
 	(also partially destroyed) buildings around the roads. You will never guess what biome they generate in - The Mushroom Plains. 
 	(Just kidding - It's the Jungle Biome.)  Cyclops Brutes and Cyclops barrages can be found within these crumbling towns.
 
- **Ice Palaces** are large-ish structures that spawn in Snowy Taigas.  They are composed of a central cabin-like building surrounded by 
 	four tall towers.  All of the pieces to this structure, despite seeming disconnected from each other, are connected via 
 	underground tunnels.  Glacial Cyclopes spawn there.  Be careful - Booby traps await the unwary.
 
 
_The Following Information is technical and not fully necessary to use the mod - I included it because I know some people like to be a little more prepared/informed when exploring._
 
 
Jungle Enclaves generate around a central structure called the Town Hall.  It has two stories, and is very profitable to loot, as it has many Emerald Blocks, Hay Bales, and Barrels and Chests strewn about.  Roads spawn around the Town Hall, and each road has four possible "slots" to generate more pieces.  There are 2 stone-type houses, built of stone bricks and having very little loot (except for Melons - There are a LOT of Melons in the Stone Houses).  The four Mud Houses are much more interesting and valuable, as they have utilities such as smokers, crafting tables, smithing tables, and more.  They are built primarily out of Mud Bricks, with Jungle Log supports at the edges, and some hay on the roof.  They have a TON of loot. There is also a single "Rare Mud House", which is the only two-story-building (other than the town hall) that can spawn.  It has potions of healing, an Enchantment Table, and lots of valuable chests full of stuff like Diamonds, Emeralds, and Emeralds.  There are three Tents that have a chance of replacing any house.  Tents come in three sizes-Small, medium, and large.  They all have different loot to find, so keep an eye out.  Also, small "accessory" structures can spawn along the road as well.  Piles of Melons, Hay Bales, or Dried Kelp Blocks, target dummies made of Target Blocks, Jungle Fences, and Redstone Lamps, and cages with iron Golems can all generate on the side.
 
 
Ice Palaces have a central structure, a basement, and another basement, all of which are always the same and never generate differently.  tunnels branching out to the left and right lead you to four spires that draw from a list of six.  They are all unique and creatively designed (I'm probably biased - After all, I did invent, build, and code them).  My two favorites are a Redstone themed tower.  The top floor has a room where a series of pistons are concealing a diamond block, and the lower level has a large Redstone circuit running through it.  There is a villager trapped in the room, and pushing the button... well... I'll let you find out what it does. WARNING: It may not be ethical! (But it's a Minecraft mod so who cares.)  Also, in the front entry, there is a booby trap.  A 5x5 circle of powder snow is camouflaged against the regular snow.  If you fall for it and don't react fast enough, let's just say that it's a long drop onto pointed dripstone.
