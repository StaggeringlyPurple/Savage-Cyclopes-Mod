ITEMS
- Polar Hides are similar to Leather, and can be used to craft a Scarf.
 
- Ice Shards are sometimes dropped by Glacial Cyclopes. They can be used to craft Frostbite Arrows by crafting normal arrows by replacing the Flint with an Ice Shard.
 
- The "Frigid" Music Disc is a disk similar to Disc 11, as it has very little music but lots of sound effects, like ice cracking, splashes, and falling rocks and stones.
 
- A Bludgeon is a unique weapon that has slow attack speed but very high damage (like the Mace, however, the Bludgeon's damage is fixed and not dependent on velocity) and has a high chance to make the target "Freeze" (similar to Powder Snow).
 
- Scarfs are items that you can wear put your chest slot and prevents freezing damage. (I didn't know about Leather Armour reducing Freeze damage, so it's basically an undyeable Leather Chestplate. Lol.)
 
- Frostbite Arrows can be shot from Bows, Crossbows, and most other modded projectile-launching weapons.  They have slightly higher damage than normal arrows, and makes the target "Freeze" (similar to Powder Snow) for thirty seconds.
 
- Poison Darts can be thrown to deal up to two-and-a-half hearts of damage on contact (depending on things like the target's armor, status effects, etc.).  It also inflicts the target with Poison V (5) for thirty seconds.  This is EXTREMELY potent as it rapidly brings the target down to half a heart.
 
- Blackberries are a new "Food" source that can be eaten instantaneously and replenish four hunger points (2 drumstick icons) and three health points (1.5 hearts).  They also give you Resistance I and Strength I for thirty seconds.  They have a one-second cooldown.

- Raspberries are exactly the same as Blackberries except that instead of giving you Resistance and Strength, they give you Speed IV and Night Vision I (for thirty seconds).
                                                                                                                                                         
- Blaspberries can be crafted by combining a Raspberry and a Blackberry in a crafting grid.  They heal 6 health points (3 hearts) and eight hunger points (4 drumstick icons).  They can be consumed instantly and apply Resistance I, Strength I, Night Vision I, and Speed IV for thirty seconds.

There are a few other items, but they are still in development and will not be elaborated on until fully incorporated into the mod.
